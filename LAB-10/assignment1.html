        Trees are essential to our planet. They are not just a source of oxygen but also help maintain the balance of
        nature by absorbing carbon dioxide and providing shelter for countless species. Trees create a harmonious
        environment and are vital for human well-being. They have been a symbol of love, resilience, and growth, and
        their presence in forests, parks, and backyards makes the world a greener and more beautiful place to live.
